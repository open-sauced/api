development machines:\n\nnode>=16.7.0\nnpm>=8.0.0\ndocker>=20.10.12\nsupabase>=0.18.0\n\n🔑 Database commands\nStarting the Supabase Studio\nFirst thing we have to do for local development is start the studio locally at localhost:54321:\nnpm run db:startMake changes\nIf we are adding a new table structure, first do it visually in the Supabase Studio and test locally.\nCheck the migration difference with the following command:\nnpm run db:changesIf everything is fine we can run the following command to apply the changes to the database:\nnpm run db:commit add_table_nameTest changes\nSimplest way to test the migrations are working is to reset the local database:\nnpm run db:resetPush changes\nIf everything is fine we can push the changes to the remote database:\nnpm run db:push🔑 Supabase structure\nClick the image to see the schema diagram full documentation.\n\n🤝 Contributing\nWe encourage you to contribute to Open Sauced!
