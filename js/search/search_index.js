Prerequisites\nIn order to run the project we need the following software binaries installed on our development machines:\n\nnode>=16.7.0\nnpm>=8.0.0\ndocker>=20.10.12\nsupabase>=0.18.0\n\n🖥️ Local development\nTo install the application:\nnpm ciTo start a local copy of the app on port 3001:\nnpm run start:dev🧪 Test\nFor running the test suite, use the following command. Since the tests run in watch mode by default, some users may encounter errors about too many files being open. In this case, it may be beneficial to install watchman.\nnpm testYou can request a coverage report by running the following command:\nnpm run test:coverageFor writing tests, the rule is move business or service logic to the lib folder and write unit tests. Logic that needs to be in a React component, then leverage tools like Cypress or Vitest mocking to write tests.\n📦 Docker builds\nA development preview can also be run from docker:\ndocker build -t api.opensauced.pizza .\ndocker run -p 8080:3001 api.opensauced.pizzaAlternatively you can pull the production container and skip all builds:\ndocker run -dit -p 8080:3001 ghcr.io/open-sauced/api.opensauced.pizza🎨 Code linting\nTo check the code and styles quality, use the following command:\nnpm run lintThis will also display during development, but not break on errors.\nTo fix the linting errors, use the following command:\nnpm run formatIt is advised to run this command before committing or opening a pull request.\n📕 Types\nWe have a couple of scripts to check and adjust missing types.\nIn order to dry run what types would be added to package.json:\nnpm run types:auto-check In order to add any missing types to package.json:\nnpm run types:auto-add🚀 Production deployment\nA production deployment is a complete build of the project, including the build of the static assets.\nnpm run build🔑 Database commands\nThe API is configured to connect to a local Docker backed PostGres instance however \nyou can also connect to a remote Supabase instance by logging in via the UI and \ncopying the connection string from the settings page.\nManaging supabase migrations\nFirst thing we have to do for local development is start the studio locally at localhost:54321:\nnpm run db:startMake changes\nIf we are adding a new table structure, first do it visually in the Supabase Studio and test locally.\nCheck the migration difference with the following command:\nnpm run db:changesIf everything is fine we can run the following command to apply the changes to the database:\nnpm run db:commit add_table_nameTest changes\nSimplest way to test the migrations are working is to reset the local database:\nnpm run db:resetPush changes\nIf everything is fine we can push the changes to the remote database:\nnpm run db:push🔑 Supabase structure\nClick the image to see the schema diagram full documentation.\n\n🤝 Contributing\nWe encourage you to contribute to Open Sauced!
