the project we need the following software binaries installed on our development machines:\n\nnode>=16.7.0\nnpm>=8.0.0\ndocker>=20.10.12\n\n🖥️ Local development\n📡 Setting Up Your Supabase Instance\nBefore setting up your local PostgreSQL database, a Supabase instance should be created. To do this, follow these steps:\n1. Create a new Supabase project: Visit Supabase and create a new project.\n2. Set Environment Variables in .env file: Once your project is created, Supabase will provide a URL and an API key. Set these in your project's .env file:\nSUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url\nSUPABASE_API_KEY=your_supabase_api_key\nSUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_supabase_jwt_secret\nAPI_DOMAIN=your_api_domainReplace your_supabase_url, your_supabase_api_key, your_supabase_jwt_secret, and your_api_domain with the actual values provided by Supabase and your project's settings.\n🗄️ Setting Up A PostgreSQL Database Locally\nA PostgreSQL Docker container has been set up to facilitate local development. After navigating to the dev/ directory, this container can be set up as follows:\n1. Obtain SSL Certificates:For secure SSL communication, you need a pair of SSL certificates: server.crt and server.key. You can generate self-signed certificates by using OpenSSL:\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj \"/CN=localhost\"Please note that this generates self-signed certificates which should only be used for local development.\n2.Build the Docker image:\ndocker build -t my_postgres_image -f Dockerfile.local-postgres .This command will build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory. The previously generated SSL certificates will need to be in the same directory as the Dockerfile.\n3.Run the Docker container:\ndocker run --name my_postgres_container -p 25060:5432 -d my_postgres_image:latestThis command will start a new Docker container named my_postgres_container, mapping port 25060 on your local machine to port 5432 on the Docker container.\nOnce the database is stood up,\ncan use the dev/apply-migrations.sh script to apply all the migrations in\nthe migrations/ directory.\n🛠️ Installation\nTo install the application:\nnpm ciTo start a local copy of the app on port 3001:\nnpm run start:dev🧪 Test\nFor running the test suite, use the following command. Since the tests run in watch mode by default, some users may encounter errors about too many files being open. In this case, it may be beneficial to install watchman.\nnpm testYou can request a coverage report by running the following command:\nnpm run test:coverageFor writing tests, the rule is move business or service logic to the lib folder and write unit tests. Logic that needs to be in a React component, then leverage tools like Cypress or Vitest mocking to write tests.\n📦 Docker builds\nA development preview can also be run from docker:\ndocker build -t api.opensauced.pizza .\ndocker run -p 8080:3001 api.opensauced.pizzaAlternatively you can pull the production container and skip all builds:\ndocker run -dit -p 8080:3001 ghcr.io/open-sauced/api.opensauced.pizza🎨 Code linting\nTo check the code and styles quality, use the following command:\nnpm run lintThis will also display during development, but not break on errors.\nTo fix the linting errors, use the following command:\nnpm run formatIt is advised to run this command before committing or opening a pull request.\n🕺 OpenAPI Swagger Doc\nWhen making API changes, make sure to run npm run generate:swagger to generate any new Swagger document bits.\n📕 Types\nWe have a couple of scripts to check and adjust missing types.\nIn order to dry run what types would be added to package.json:\nnpm run types:auto-checkIn order to add any missing types to package.json:\nnpm run types:auto-add🚀 Production deployment\nA production deployment is a complete build of the project, including the build of the static assets.\nnpm run build🍕 Pizza service integration\nThis API integrates with the pizza service\nto accept requests for ingesting commits to the database.\nThe environment variables for this are:\nPIZZA_OVEN_HOST=\"http://example.com\"\nPIZZA_OVEN_API=80🔑 Database structure\nClick the image to see the schema diagram full documentation.\n\n🤝 Contributing\nWe encourage you to contribute to Open Sauced!

data from the Open Sauced community platform.\nThe Swagger-UI provides useful information to get started and an overview of all available resources.\nEach API route is clickable and has their own detailed description on how to use it.\nThe base URL for the API is [${apiDomain}](https://${apiDomain}).\n\n[comment]: # (TODO: add bearer auth information)\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nEvery IP address is allowed to perform 5000 requests per hour.\nThis is measured by saving the date of the initial request and counting all requests in the next hour.\nWhen an IP address goes over the limit, HTTP status code 429 is returned.\nThe returned HTTP headers of any API request show the current rate limit status:\n\nheader | description\n--- | ---\n\\`X-RateLimit-Limit\\` | The maximum number of requests allowed per hour\n\\`X-RateLimit-Remaining\\` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window\n\\`X-RateLimit-Reset\\` | The date and time at which the current rate limit window resets in [UTC epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)\n\n[comment]: # (TODO: add pagination information)\n\n## Common response codes\n\nEach route shows for each method which data
